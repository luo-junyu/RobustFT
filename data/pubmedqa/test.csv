591,"Article: (Introduction) As with some procedures, trauma fellowship training and greater surgeon experience may result in better outcomes following intramedullary nailing (IMN) of diaphyseal femur fractures. However, surgeons with such training and experience may not always be available to all patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trauma training affects the post-operative difference in femoral version (DFV) following IMN.
(Materials and methods) Between 2000 and 2009, 417 consecutive patients with diaphyseal femur fractures (AO/OTA 32A-C) were treated via IMN. Inclusion criteria for this study included complete baseline and demographic documentation as well as pre-operative films for fracture classification and post-operative CT scanogram (per institutional protocol) for version and length measurement of both the nailed and uninjured femurs. Exclusion criteria included bilateral injuries, multiple ipsilateral lower extremity fractures, previous injury, and previous deformity. Of the initial 417 subjects, 355 patients met our inclusion criteria. Other data included in our analysis were age, sex, injury mechanism, open vs. closed fracture, daytime vs. nighttime surgery, mechanism of injury, and AO and Winquist classifications. Post-operative femoral version of both lower extremities was measured on CT scanogram by an orthopaedic trauma fellowship trained surgeon. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine statistically significant risk factors for malrotation between the two cohorts.
(Results) Overall, 80.3% (288/355) of all fractures were fixed by trauma-trained surgeons. The mean post-operative DFV was 8.7° in these patients, compared to 10.7° in those treated by surgeons of other subspecialties. This difference was not statistically significant when accounting for other factors in a multivariate model (p>0.05). The same statistical trend was true when analyzing outcomes of only the more severe Winquist type III and IV fractures. Additionally, surgeon experience was not significantly predictive of post-operative version for either trauma or non-trauma surgeons (p>0.05 for both).

760,"(Objectives) To determine whether there are differences between blood pressure (BP) measured by the nurse (NBP), BP measured by the physician (PBP) and self-measured BP in treated hypertensive patients and, if found, to evaluate their clinical importance.
(Method) An observational study is carried out with hypertensive patients recruited from two village-based community health centres in Catalonia (Spain) serving an area with a total population of 2800 inhabitants. All patients treated for hypertension visiting the health centre on a specific day of the week and during the same timetable between October 2000 and May 2001 were included.
(Results) The difference between physician-systolic BP and nurse-systolic BP was 5.16 mmHg (95% CI 2.62-7.7; p<0.001). The difference between physician-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP was 4.67 mmHg (95% CI 0.89-8.44; p=0.016). The differences between nurse-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP were not significant (0.49 mmHg; 95% CI 3.71-2.71; p=0.758). With regards to diastolic BP, no significant differences were found between the different ways of measurement. NBP gave the following values: sensitivity (Sn) of 92% and specificity (Sp) of 60%; positive predictive value (PPV) of 65.7% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90% with a positive coefficient of probability (CP+) of 2.3 and a negative coefficient of probability (CP-) of 0.133. PBP gave the following results: Sn=72%; Sp=66.7%; PPV=64.3%; NPV=74.1%; CP+=2.16 and CP- = 0.420.

(Background) With the advancement of an aging society in the world, an increasing number of elderly patients have been hospitalized due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). There is no study that compares the elderly cases of aSAH who receive the definitive treatment with those who treated conservatively. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the definitive surgery for the acute subarachnoid cases aged 80 or older.
(Methods) We reviewed 500 consecutive cases with acute aSAH with surgical indication for aneurysm repair. Inoperable cases such as dead-on-arrival and the cases with both pupils dilated were excluded. We compared the cases aged 80 or older that received clipping or coil embolization with the controls that the family selected conservative treatment.
(Results) 69 cases were included in this study (ranged 80-98, male:female=9:60). 56 cases (81.2%) had an aneurysm in the anterior circulation. 23 cases received clipping, 20 cases coil embolization and 26 cases treated conservatively. The cases with aneurysm repair showed significantly better clinical outcome than the controls, while World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade on admission and premorbid modified Rankin Scale showed no difference between them.

963,"(Background and aim of the study) The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the hemodynamic performance of the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses in the aortic position, and to evaluate prosthesis-specific differences in valve sizing and valve-size labeling.
(Methods) Between August 2000 and September 2002, 139 patients underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) with the Mosaic (n = 67) or Perimount (n = 72) bioprosthesis. Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively.
(Results) Operative mortality was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS). Upsizing (using a prosthesis larger in labeled valve size than the patient's measured internal aortic annulus diameter) was possible in 28.4% of Mosaic patients and 8.3% of Perimount patients. The postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient ranged from 10.5 to 22.2 mmHg in the Mosaic group, and from 9.4 to 12.6 mmHg in the Perimount group; it was significantly lower for 21 and 23 Perimount valves than for 21 and 23 Mosaic valves. The EOA ranged from 0.78 to 2.37 cm2 in Mosaic patients, and from 0.95 to 2.12 cm2 in Perimount patients. When indexing EOA by calculating the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area to adjust for variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions, there was no significant difference between the two bioprostheses.

241,"Please answer a question about the following text: (Methods) In this single-centre prospective study, triage nurses estimated the probability of admission using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and GAPS was generated automatically from triage data. We compared calibration using rank sum tests, discrimination using area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and accuracy with McNemar's test.
(Results) Of 1829 attendances, 745 (40.7%) were admitted, not significantly different from GAPS' prediction of 750 (41.0%, p=0.678). In contrast, the nurses' mean VAS predicted 865 admissions (47.3%), overestimating by 6.6% (p<0.0001). GAPS discriminated between admission and discharge as well as nurses, its AUC 0.876 compared with 0.875 for VAS (p=0.93). As a binary predictor, its accuracy was 80.6%, again comparable with VAS (79.0%), p=0.18. In the minority of attendances, when nurses felt at least 95% certain of the outcome, VAS' accuracy was excellent, at 92.4%. However, in the remaining majority, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration (+1.2% vs +9.2%, p<0.0001), discrimination (AUC 0.810 vs 0.759, p=0.001) and accuracy (75.1% vs 68.9%, p=0.0009). When we used GAPS, but 'over-ruled' it when clinical certainty was ≥95%, this significantly outperformed either method, with AUC 0.891 (0.877-0.907) and accuracy 82.5% (80.7%-84.2%).

928,"(Objective) To correlate magnetic resonance (MR) image findings with pain response by provocation discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, with an emphasis on the combination analysis of a high intensity zone (HIZ) and disc contour abnormalities.
(Materials and methods) Sixty-two patients (aged 17-68 years) with axial low back pain that was likely to be disc related underwent lumbar discography (178 discs tested). The MR images were evaluated for disc degeneration, disc contour abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based on the combination of an HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were determined: (1) normal or bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc with HIZ; (3) disc protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ. These MR image findings and a new combined MR classification were analyzed in the base of concordant pain determined by discography.
(Results) Disc protrusion with HIZ [sensitivity 45.5%; specificity 97.8%; positive predictive value (PPV), 87.0%] correlated significantly with concordant pain provocation (P<0.01). A normal or bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Disc degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) were not helpful in the identification of a disc with concordant pain.

(Background and study objective) Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is necessary.
(Patients and method) The study group included 350 consecutive patients who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 h after the procedure in all cases. Additionally, the following information was recorded in all patients: sex, age, immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies done, segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and development of symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax.
(Results) Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 patients (2.9%). Seven patients had symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax prior to CXR, including four patients with large (>10%) pneumothorax. The other three patients were asymptomatic, with only minimal pneumothorax (</= 10%), which resolved completely 24 to 48 h later.

(Background) Tuberculosis (TB) patients face numerous difficulties adhering to the long-term, rigorous TB treatment regimen. Findings on TB patients' treatment adherence vary across existing literature and official reports. The present study attempted to determine the actual treatment adherence of new TB patients and to identify factors leading to non-adherence.
(Methods) A prospective cohort of 481 newly confirmed TB patients from three counties in western China were enrolled during June to December 2012 and was followed until June 2013. Patients who missed at least one dose of drugs or one follow-up re-examination during the treatment course were deemed as non-adherent. Influencing factors were identified using a logistic regression model.
(Results) A total of 173 (36.0 %) patients experienced non-adherence and the loss to follow-up cases reached 136 (28.2 %). Only 13.9 % of patients took drugs under direct observation, and 60.5 % of patients were supervised by phone calls. Factor analyses suggested that patients who were observed by family members (OR:5.54, 95 % CI:2.87-10.69) and paying monthly service expenses above 450 RMB (OR:2.08, 95 % CI:1.35-3.19) were more likely to be non-adherent, while supervision by home visit (OR:0.06, 95 % CI:0.01-0.28) and phone calls (OR:0.27, 95 % CI:0.17-0.44) were protective factors.

(Methods) The study took the form of in vitro measurement of endogenous pH and titratable acidity (mmol). Endogenous pH was measured using a pH meter, followed by titration to pH 7.0 with 0.1-M NaOH.
(Results) Overall, 55 (57%) formulations had an endogenous pH of<5.5. The mean (+/- SD) endogenous pH and titratable acidity for 41 SC formulations were 5.26 +/- 1.30 and 0.139 +/- 0.133 mmol, respectively; for 56 sugars-free (SF) formulations, these figures were 5.73 +/- 1.53 and 0.413 +/- 1.50 mmol (P>0.05). Compared with their SC bioequivalents, eight SF medicines showed no significant differences for pH or titratable acidity, while 15 higher-strength medicines showed lower pH (P = 0.035) and greater titratable acidity (P = 0.016) than their lower-strength equivalents. Chewable and dispersible tablets (P<0.001), gastrointestinal medicines (P = 0.002) and antibiotics (P = 0.007) were significant predictors of higher pH.

The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity.
(Patients and methods) 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated.
(Results) Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups.

794,"(Background and objectives) Controversy exists regarding the optimal enteral feeding regimen of very low birth weight infants (VLBW). Rapid advancement of enteral feeding has been associated with an increased rate of necrotizing enterocolitis. In contrast, delaying enteral feeding may have unfavorable effects on nutrition, growth, and neurodevelopment. The aim is to compare the short-term outcomes of VLBW infants in tertiary care centers according to their enteral feeding advancement.
(Patients and methods) We prospectively studied the influence of center-specific enteral feeding advancement in 1430 VLBW infants recruited from 13 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in Germany on short-term outcome parameters. The centers were post hoc stratified to ""rapid advancement to full enteral feeds"" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds<or =12.5 days; 6 centers), that is, rapid advancement (RA), or ""slow advancement to full enteral feeds"" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds>12.5 days; 7 centers), that is, slow advancement (SA).
(Results) VLBW infants born in centers with SA (n = 713) had a significantly higher rate of sepsis compared with VLBW infants born in centers with RA (n = 717), which was particularly evident for late-onset sepsis (14.0% vs 20.4%; P = 0.002).

A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age.
(Methods) Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations.
(Results) At full term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification.

(Objective) To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of this disorder in healthy adult men.
(Methods) This was a cross-sectional study in which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of<198.4 ng/dL was used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM.
(Results) A total of 78 men (81.3%) were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 382.1+/-247.3 in those>70 years; however this was not statistically significant (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of PADAM.

(Background) Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
(Methods) Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
(Results) From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

(Materials and methods) 79 adjacent proximal surfaces without restorations in permanent teeth were examined. Patients suspected to have carious lesions after a visual clinical and a bitewing examination participated in a CBCT examination (Kodak 9000 3D, 5 × 3.7 cm field of view, voxel size 0.07 mm). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained according to the Helsinki Declaration. Radiographic assessment recording lesions with or without cavitation was performed by two observers in bitewings and CBCT sections. Orthodontic separators were placed interdentally between two lesion-suspected surfaces. The separator was removed after 3 days and the surfaces recorded as cavitated (yes/no), i.e. validated clinically. Differences between the two radiographic modalities (sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy) were estimated by analyzing the binary data in a generalized linear model.
(Results) For both observers, sensitivity was significantly higher for CBCT than for bitewings (average difference 33%, p<0.001) while specificity was not significantly different between the methods (p = 0.19). The overall accuracy was also significantly higher for CBCT (p<0.001).

78,"(Objective) To examine family-based transmission of the number of 5' flanking arginine vasopressin V1a receptor (AVPR1A) microsatellites, which include [(GATA)(14)] and complex [(CT)(4)-TT-(CT)(8)-(GT)(24)]repeats, in probands with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype (PEA-BP). Preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands was hypothesized, based on reports from preclinical work in the literature.
(Methods) Probands were 83 participants in an ongoing controlled study of PEA-BP. The PEA-BP phenotype was defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania (elation and/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated allele-calling software. There were 32 complete, biological trios (28 informative families) for the GATA repeat and 34 complete, biological trios (30 informative families) for the complex repeat. Data were analyzed using case-control and family-based association methods.
(Results) Preferential transmission of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats was not significant for hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking, using the transmission disequilibrium test. Similarly, case-control analyses found no significant associations between hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats. For p<0.05, there was about 80% power to detect odds ratios of 5.0 and 4.0 (in the family-based analyses) and 3.5 and 2.6 (in the case-control analyses), for allele frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively.

(Methods) As part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) a cross-sectional prevalence study of 1321 children (mean age = 11.4 years, range: 10.1-12.5) was conducted in Hastings, New Zealand. Using standard questions we collected data on the prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms, as well as food frequency data. Skin prick tests were performed to common environmental allergens and exercise-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed according to a standard protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2) and classified into overweight and obese according to a standard international definition.
(Results) After adjusting for lifestyle factors, including other diet and BMI variables, compared with children who never ate hamburgers, we found an independent risk of hamburger consumption on having a history of wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.52)] and on current wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.80-1.70) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.10-2.98)].

Elevated cTn and echocardiogrpahic documentation of wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) that were recorded after extreme physical effort raise the question whether dobutamine stress echo (DSE), can also induce elevation of troponin.
(Methods) we prospective enrolled stable patients (age>18 years) referred to DSE. The exam was performed under standardized conditions. Blood samples for cTnI were obtained at baseline and 18-24 hours after the test. We aimed to compare between the clinical and echocardiographic features of patients with elevated cTnI and those without cTnI elevations.
(Results) Fifty-seven consecutive patients were included. The average age was 64.4 ± 10.7, 73% of the patients were males, and nearly half of the patients were known to have ischemic heart disease. Two of the patients were excluded due to technical difficulty. No signs of ischemia were recorded in 25 (45.4%). Among the patients with established ischemia on DSE, 12 (22%) had mild ischemia, 13 (23.6%) had moderate and 5 (9%) had severe ischemia. Angiography was performed in 13 (26%) of the patients, of which 7 had PCI and one was referred to bypass surgery. None of the patients had elevated cTnI 18-24 hours after the DSE.

The aim of our study was to compare the extent of preknowledge of procedures and test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer and overall patient satisfaction between a patient group referred for outpatient open access endoscopy versus a patient group from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic.
(Methods) Information was obtained from all patients presenting for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy by using a 1-page questionnaire. Patients from the two groups who had an outpatient upper/lower endoscopic procedure were contacted by phone after the procedure to obtain information with a standardized questionnaire.
(Results) The open access patients reported receiving significantly less information to help them identify the procedure (p<0.01) and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure than the group of patients referred from the subspecialty clinic (p<0.005). There was no difference between the two groups in satisfaction scores for examinations performed under conscious sedation. For flexible sigmoidoscopy without sedation, however, the GI clinic patient group were more satisfied with their procedure. The majority of patients, regardless of access, were more likely to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist than the referring physician.

Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance.
(Results) The mean stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1).

Antibody concentrations against tetanus, diphtheria, tickborne encephalitis and influenza were assessed by ELISA or by haemagglutination inhibition test. Disease and vaccination histories were recorded.
(Results) The results of the study demonstrate that protection against infectious diseases was frequently insufficient in the elderly. This was partly due to the fact that old persons were not vaccinated according to recommended strategies.

587,"(Background) There is a positive association between chronic inflammation and the risk of cardiovascular disease, but whether there is an association between C-reactive protein (CRP) and carotid atherosclerosis is controversial. We investigated the relationship between high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in healthy Koreans.
(Design) We measured hsCRP levels, the carotid IMT, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors including obesity parameters, blood pressure, lipid profiles, insulin resistance, and smoking habits in 820 volunteers (35-79 years old) in a cross-sectional study.
(Results) Higher hsCRP quartile groups had higher mean IMTs, as compared with the lowest quartile (P<0.001 for the trend across quartiles). However, after adjustment for age, the relationship between hsCRP level and IMT was substantially weaker (P = 0.018). After additional adjustments for conventional cardiovascular risk factors, no significant association was observed (P = 0.548). The unadjusted risk for a high carotid IMT value (>or = 1.0 mm) was also positively related to hsCRP quartile, but this relationship was not significant after adjustment for age and other cardiovascular risk factors.

(Design) Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a cost-utility analysis using a life-time Markov model.
(Setting) The RCT was undertaken in Glasgow, Scotland. The economic analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective.
(Participants) A total of 612 pregnant women randomized to receive usual cessation support plus or minus financial incentives of up to £400 vouchers (US $609), contingent upon smoking cessation.
(Measurements) Comparison of usual support and incentive interventions in terms of cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct costs to the NHS.
(Findings) The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was £1127 ($1716).This is similar to the standard look-up value derived from Stapleton&West's published ICER tables, £1390 per quitter, by looking up the Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial (CIPT) incremental cost (£157) and incremental 6-month quit outcome (0.14). The life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of £17 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -£93, £107] and a gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% CI = -0.058, 0.145), giving an ICER of £482/QALY ($734/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates uncertainty in these results, particularly regarding relapse after birth.

(Setting) Academic, level I trauma and intensive care unit centers.
(Patients) Blunt-injured adults with hemorrhagic shock.
(Interventions) None.
(Measurements and main results) Separate Cox proportional hazard regression models were formulated based on all patients to evaluate the effects of gender on mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection, after controlling for all important confounders. These models were then used to characterize the effect of gender in young and old age groups. Overall mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection rates for the entire cohort (n = 1,036) were 20%, 40%, and 45%, respectively. Mean Injury Severity Score was 32 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD). Men (n = 680) and women (n = 356) were clinically similar except that men required higher crystalloid volumes, more often had a history of alcoholism and liver disease, and had greater ventilatory and intensive care unit requirements. Female gender was independently associated with a 43% and 23% lower risk of multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection, respectively.

(Background) Previous studies have reported that the total bilirubin (TB) level is associated with coronary artery disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. These heart diseases can produce cardiogenic cerebral embolism and cause cardioembolic stroke. However, whether the serum TB could be a biomarker to differentiate cardioembolic stroke from other stroke subtypes is unclear.
(Methods) Our study consisted of 628 consecutive patients with ischaemic stroke. Various clinical and laboratory variables of the patients were analysed according to serum TB quartiles and stroke subtypes.
(Results) The higher TB quartile group was associated with atrial fibrillation, larger left atrium diameter, lower left ventricular fractional shortening and cardioembolic stroke (P<0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.033, P<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, serum TB was a statistically significant independent predictor of cardioembolic stroke in a multivariable setting (Continuous, per unit increase OR = 1.091, 95%CI: 1.023-1.164, P = 0.008).

(Material and methods) We performed a retrospective cohort study from December 2009 to February 2012 with analysis of demographic, clinical and biochemical data from two obstetric day assessment units in hospitals in Southeast Scotland. We included 717 pregnant women, with singleton pregnancies after 20 weeks' gestation, referred for evaluation of suspected preeclampsia and having their first ACR performed. The ability of ACR to predict future outcomes was assessed in both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The latter assessed its prognostic value independent of (adjusting for) existing prognostic factors. Primary outcome measures were maternal and neonatal composite adverse outcomes, and a secondary outcome was gestation at delivery.
(Results) In all, 204 women (28.5%) experienced a composite adverse maternal outcome and 146 women (20.4%) experienced a composite adverse neonatal outcome. Multivariate analysis of log-transformed ACR demonstrated that a 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal [odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-1.80] and adverse neonatal (odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29) composite outcomes, and with reduced gestational age at delivery (coefficient: -0.46, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.38).

(Methods) Children aged 0-14 years treated in Denmark for a cerebellar astrocytoma in the period 1960-1984 were included and followed until January 2001 or until their death. The histological specimens from each patient were reviewed for revised grading and classification according to three different classification schemes: the WHO, the Kernohan and the Daumas-Duport grading systems.
(Results) The overall survival rate was 81% after a follow-up time of 15-40 years. The significant positive prognostic factors for survival were ""surgically gross-total removal"" of the tumour at surgery and location of the tumour in the cerebellum proper as opposed to location in the fourth ventricle. No difference in survival time was demonstrated when we compared pilocytic astrocytoma and fibrillary astrocytoma.

923,"(Purpose) A higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in HIV-infected patients, together with chronic infection and treatments, has resulted in an increased risk of silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI). The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.
(Methods) The prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.
(Results) Coronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %.

(Background) It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer resection.
(Objective) The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers.
(Design) This was a population-based study.
(Settings) The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal cancer.
(Patients) Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included.
(Main outcome measures) The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival.
(Results) A total of 18,605 patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a lymph node yield ≥12 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in the long-distance/high-volume group.

These criteria are of special importance when cardiac surgery is indicated for other reasons but the established criteria for aortic valve replacement are not yet fulfilled. Such aspects of therapeutic planing were mostly disregarded in the past so that patients had to undergo cardiac reoperation within a few years.

(Results) The progression rate of aortic valve obstruction was found to be dependent on the degree of valvar calcification ([VC] scoring 0 to III) and to be exponentially correlated with the aortic valve opening area (AVA) at initial catheterization. Neither age nor sex of the patient nor etiology of the valvar obstruction significantly influence the progression of aortic stenosis. If AVA decreases below 0.75 cm(2) with a present degree of VC = 0, or AVA of 0.8 with VC of I, AVA of 0.9 with VC of II, or AVA of 1.0 with VC of III, it is probable that aortic stenosis will have to be operated upon in the following years.

(Methods and materials) DW images of endometrial cancer in 23 patients were examined by using a 1.5-T MR scanner. This study investigated whether or not DW images offer additional incremental value to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging in comparison with histopathological results. Moreover, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in the regions of interest within the endometrial cancer and compared with those of normal endometrium and myometrium in 31 volunteers, leiomyoma in 14 patients and adenomyosis in 10 patients. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used, with a p<0.05 considered statistically significant.
(Results) In 19 of 23 patients, endometrial cancers were detected only on T2-weighted images. In the remaining 4 patients, of whom two had coexisting leiomyoma, no cancer was detected on T2-weighted images. This corresponds to an 83% detection sensitivity for the carcinomas. When DW images and fused DW images/T2-weighted images were used in addition to the T2-weighted images, cancers were identified in 3 of the remaining 4 patients in addition to the 19 patients (overall detection sensitivity of 96%). The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer (n=22) was (0.97+/-0.19)x10(-3)mm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than those of the normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma and adenomyosis (p<0.05).

(Objective) To define the concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue of patients with hydatidiform mole and assess their value as a clinical marker of the condition.
(Design) Prospective study of new patients with hydatidiform mole, comparison of paired observations, and case-control analysis.
(Setting) A university hospital, two large public hospitals, and a private women's clinic in Japan.
(Patients) Seven consecutive referred patients seen over four months with newly diagnosed complete hydatidiform mole, including one in whom the mole was accompanied by viable twin fetuses (case excluded from statistical analysis because of unique clinical features). All patients followed up for six months after evacuation of molar tissue.
(End point) Correlation of serum inhibin concentrations with trophoblastic disease.
(Measurements and main results) Serum concentrations of inhibin, human chorionic gonadotrophin, and follicle stimulating hormone were compared before and seven to 10 days after evacuation of the mole. Before evacuation the serum inhibin concentrations (median 8.3 U/ml; 95% confidence interval 2.4 to 34.5) were significantly greater than in 21 normal women at the same stage of pregnancy (2.8 U/ml; 2.1 to 3.6), and inhibin in molar tissue was also present in high concentrations (578 U/ml cytosol; 158 to 1162). Seven to 10 days after evacuation inhibin concentrations in serum samples from the same patients declined significantly to values (0.4 U/ml; 0.1 to 1.4) similar to those seen in the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles. None of the four patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. Though serum human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations declined after evacuation (6.6 x 10(3) IU/l; 0.8 x 10(3) to 32.6 x 10(3], they remained far higher than in non-pregnant women.

Fluoridation's effect on restorative dental demand among 972 Washington state employees and spouses, aged 20 to 34 years, in two fluoridated communities and a nonfluoridated community was examined.
(Methods) At baseline, adults were interviewed by telephone, and oral assessments were conducted to measure personal characteristics, lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, oral disease, and the quality of restorations. Adults were followed for 2 years to measure dental demand from dental claims. Each adult's baseline and claims data were linked with provider and practice variables collected from the dentist who provided treatment.
(Results) Relative to adults with no lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, adults drinking fluoridated water for half or more of their lives had less disease at baseline and a lower but nonsignificant probability of receiving a restoration in the follow-up period. In the 2-year follow-up period, however, more than half of the restorations were performed to replace fillings of satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline. When only teeth with decay and unsatisfactory fillings at baseline were considered, adults with high fluoridation exposure had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than adults with no exposure. Market effects also were detected in demand equations; relative to adults in the nonfluoridated community, adults residing in the fluoridated community with a large dentist supply received a greater number of restorations, suggesting potential supplier-induced demand from less disease and fewer patients.

(Methods) We examined 680 unrelated FAP families for germline mutations in the APC gene. Clinical information was obtained from 1256 patients.
(Results) APC mutations were detected in 48% (327/680) of families. Age at diagnosis of FAP based on bowel symptoms and age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in untreated patients were used as indicators of the severity of the natural course of the disease. A germline mutation was detected in 230 of 404 patients who were diagnosed after onset of bowel symptoms (rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhoea). When these patients were grouped according to the different sites of mutations, mean values for age at onset of disease differed significantly: patients carrying APC mutations at codon 1309 showed a disease onset 10 years earlier (mean age 20 years) compared with patients with mutations between codons 168 and 1580 (except codon 1309) (mean age 30 years), whereas patients with mutations at the 5' end of codon 168 or the 3' end of codon 1580 were diagnosed at a mean age of 52 years.

Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion rate during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, body fat percentage was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, and CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. Associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity and body fat percentage with the Framingham risk score were assessed in linear regression models.
(Results) Both fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose levels were associated with higher Framingham risk score (fasting glucose: r(2) = 0.21; 2-hour glucose: r(2) = 0.24; P<0.001 for both), and insulin sensitivity with lower Framingham risk score (r(2) = 0.36; P<0.001). However, adjustment for insulin sensitivity and 2-hour glucose made the effect of fasting glucose non-significant (P = 0.060). Likewise, when adjusting for insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score disappeared (P = 0.143). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was still associated with Framingham risk score after adjusting for glucose levels (P<0.001).

(Rationale) Associations between several psychopathological alterations and lowered beta-endorphin(beta E) plasma levels have already been stated in former studies. However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters.
(Objectives) The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving.
(Methods) We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined.
(Results) In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation was largely independent from ACTH. In addition, a significant inverse relationship was found between beta E and craving on day 14 (r=-0.28). No association appeared between beta E and depression.

The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident wheezing. After controlling for confounding factors, the risk of persistent wheezing among obese individuals at 11 years was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.30-2.54).

704,"Article: (Objectives) Cerebral hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure undergone to control intractable seizures, is becoming a standard procedure with more cases identified and treated early in life [33]. While the effect of the dominant hemisphere resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.
(Methods) Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2].
(Results) We found that about 60% of our group developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range. Phonological processing measured by both phonological awareness and nonword reading was unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants. Phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory, a component of phonological processing skills, together with receptive vocabulary size, positively correlated with reading levels similar to those reported in average readers. Receptive vocabulary, a bilateral function, was preserved to a certain degree similar to that of strongly left-lateralized phonological skills [3]. Later seizure onset was associated with better reading levels.

(Methods) A retrospective cohort study of patients aged 2 to 18 years admitted to the King Abdul Aziz Medical City between May 2001 and May 2009 was conducted. Patients were categorized as lean (body mass index<95th percentile) and obese (body mass index ≥ 95th percentile). Groups were compared regarding admission demographics, mechanism of injury, pattern of injury, length of stay, intensive care unit admission, ventilation duration, types of procedures performed, injury severity score, and mortality.
(Result) Nine hundred thirty-three patients were included, of those 55 (5.89%) children were obese. The obese children were older than nonobese (P = .001) and had a higher injury severity score (P = .001) and a lower pediatric trauma score (P = .00), heart rate (P = .0081), and respiratory rate (P = .000). There were no differences between groups with regard to sex, mechanism of injury, and surgical procedures. Obese children were more likely to have rib fractures (P = .02) and pelvic injuries (P = .033). There was no significant association between mortality and obesity (P = .42).

(Purpose) Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is characterized by neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.
(Methods) We searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).
(Results) Unlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining.

8,"(Background) Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are an effective treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, patients receiving AIs report a higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures; the mechanism and risk factors for this correlation are not well studied. The aim of this study was to correlate these musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures in patients receiving AIs with bone mineral density (BMD), previous tamoxifen use, and administration of calcium/bisphosphonate (Ca/Bis).
(Patients and methods) We reviewed charts of 856 patients with hormone receptor-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer seen at our institution between January 1999 and October 2007. A total of 316 patients met the inclusion criteria of treatment with one of the AIs for>or = 3 months and availability of a dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) during this treatment. Arthralgia, generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, bone fracture after beginning AIs, any tamoxifen treatment, and Ca/Bis therapy were recorded.
(Results) Our study demonstrates a significant association between symptoms and DEXA-BMD results (P<.001). Similarly, the group receiving tamoxifen before AIs had fewer patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain/myalgia or bone fracture (P<.001). Furthermore, the group receiving AIs plus Ca/Bis had more patients without musculoskeletal symptoms and had fewer fractures. Finally, the group receiving steroidal AIs compared with nonsteroidal AIs had more patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, and bone fractures (P<.001).

(Background and purpose) Our aim was to determine the value of echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging (epiDWI) in differentiating various types of primary parotid gland tumors.
(Materials and methods) One hundred forty-nine consecutive patients with suspected tumors of the parotid gland were examined with an epiDWI sequence by using a 1.5T unit. Image analysis was performed by 2 radiologists independently, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was computed. Histologic diagnosis was obtained in every patient. For comparison of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), a paired 2-tailed Student t test with a Bonferroni correction was used.
(Results) In 136 patients, a primary parotid gland tumor was confirmed by histology. Among the observers, a high correlation was calculated (0.98). ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher than those of all other entities, except for myoepithelial adenomas (P = .054). ADC values of Warthin tumors were different from those of myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas (P<.001, 0.013, and .037, respectively).

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer.
(Methods) Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up.
(Results) The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in each case. Two patients had a change in therapy independent of the position emission tomography scan due to clinical circumstances.

322,"Article: (Objectives) First, to establish whether a deprivation gradient in all-cause mortality exists for all ethnic groups within New Zealand; second, if such gradients do exist, whether their absolute slopes are the same; and third, if such gradients exist, what impact the unequal deprivation distributions of the different ethnic groups have on the observed ethnic inequalities in life expectancy at birth.
(Method) Abridged lifetables for the period 1999-2003 were constructed using standard demographic methods for each of four ethnic groups (Asian, Pacific, Maori and European) by NZDep2001 quintile and sex. Gradients were estimated by fitting generalised linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy estimates for each ethnic group (by sex). The contribution of variation in deprivation distributions to inter-ethnic inequalities in life expectancy was estimated by re-weighting the quintile-specific mortality rates for each ethnic group using weights derived from the European deprivation distribution and recalculating the lifetable.
(Results) All four ethnic groups exhibit deprivation gradients in all-cause mortality (life expectancy). Maori show the steepest gradients, with slopes approximately 25% steeper than those of Europeans for both males and females. By contrast, gradients among Asian and Pacific peoples are shallower than those of their European counterparts.

(Objective) Various factors contribute to the effective implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs). In this study, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes.
(Method) We used an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the therapists and emerging themes were coded.
(Results) When initial level of severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald&Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska,&Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists. The trainer, blind to the results, identified the following characteristics and actions of effective therapists: effectively addressing patient avoidance, language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance.

(Introduction) Microbial contamination can be a marker for faulty process and is assumed to play an important role in the collection of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) and infusion procedure. We aimed to determine the microbial contamination rates and evaluate the success of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients who received contaminated products.PATIENTS-
(Methods) We analyzed microbial contamination records of HPC grafts between 2012 and 2015, retrospectively. Contamination rates of autologous donors were evaluated for at three steps: at the end of mobilization, following processing with dimethyl sulfoxide, and just before stem cell infusion. Grafts of allogeneic donors were assessed only before HCT.
(Result) A total of 445 mobilization procedures were carried out on 333 (167 autologous and 166 allogeneic) donors. The microbiological contamination of peripheral blood (323/333 donations) and bone marrow (10/333 donations) products were analyzed. Bacterial contamination was detected in 18 of 1552 (1.15 %) culture bottles of 333 donors. During the study period 248 patients underwent HCT and among these patients microbial contamination rate on sample basis was 1.3 % (16/1212). Microbial contamination detected in nine patients (7 autologous; 2 allogeneic). In 8 of 9 patients, a febrile neutropenic attack was observed. The median day for the neutropenic fever was 4 days (0-9). None of the patients died within the post-transplant 30 days who received contaminated products.

(Objective) This study aims to determine whether the clinical effects of abdominal desmoids would be worse in patients with restorative proctocolectomy than in patients with ileorectal anastomosis.
(Design) This is a retrospective, database study.
(Patients) Included were patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who had undergone proctocolectomy with IPAA or colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, and subsequently developed an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor.
(Main outcome measures) The primary outcome measures were the clinical course of the desmoids; morbidity, and the requirement for stoma.
(Results) There were 86 patients: 49 had restorative proctocolectomy and 37 had ileorectal anastomosis. Patient demographics were similar. Average follow-up was 9.8 years (range, 2.7-23.8) and 16.3 years (range, 2.3 - 42.9). Treatment of the desmoids included surgery (64.4% vs 65.6%), medical therapy (69.4% vs 59.5%), chemotherapy (36.2% vs 30.0%), and radiotherapy (4.5% vs 10.0%), and was the same for each group. The overall complication rate of desmoids was similar, approaching 70%.

(Background) Regular inhalation of tobacco smoke, whether it be voluntary or not, may have profound negative effects on the body. Also intervertebral discs may be affected. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sick leave.
(Methods) The sample comprised 5563 Norwegian nurses' aides, not on sick leave when they completed a mailed questionnaire in 1999. Of these, 4744 (85.3%) completed a second questionnaire 15 months later. The outcome measure was the incidence proportion of long-term sick leave during the 12 months prior to the follow-up.
(Results) Respondents who reported at baseline that they had been exposed to ETS at home during childhood had increased risk of sick leave exceeding 14 days attributed to neck pain (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.73), high back pain (OR=1.49; CI: 1.07-2.06), low back pain (OR=1.21; CI: 0.97-1.50), and any illness (OR=1.23; CI: 1.07-1.42), after adjustments for demographic and familial characteristics, former smoking, current smoking, physical leisure-time activities, work factors, prior neck injury, and affective symptoms.

(Methods) Field experiments were conducted with 529 adult smokers and 530 young adults (258 nonsmokers; 271 smokers). Participants reported responses to different pictorial HWLs printed on cigarette packages. One experiment involved manipulating textual form (testimonial narrative vs. didactic) and the other involved manipulating image type (diseased organs vs. human suffering).
(Results) Tests of mean ratings and rankings indicated that pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms had equivalent or significantly higher credibility, relevance, and impact than pictorial HWLs with testimonial forms. Results from mixed-effects models confirmed these results. However, responses differed by participant educational attainment: didactic forms were consistently rated higher than testimonials among participants with higher education, whereas the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative forms was weaker or not statistically significant among participants with lower education. In the second experiment, with textual content held constant, greater credibility, relevance, and impact was found for graphic imagery of diseased organs than imagery of human suffering.

(Introduction) Whether mutation status should be used to guide therapy is an important issue in many cancers. We correlated mutation profile in radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) metastatic thyroid cancers (TCs) with patient outcome and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and discussed the results with other published data.
(Materials and methods) Outcome in 82 consecutive patients with metastatic RAIR thyroid carcinoma prospectively tested for BRAF, RAS and PI3KCA mutations was retrospectively analyzed, including 55 patients treated with multikinase inhibitors.
(Results) Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) were the most frequent histological subtype (54.9 %), followed by poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma [PDTC] (30.5 %) and follicular thyroid carcinoma [FTC](14.6 %). A genetic mutation was identified in 23 patients (28 %) and BRAF was the most frequently mutated gene (23 %). Median progression-free survival (PFS) on first-line TKI treatment was 14.6 months (95% CI 9.9-18.4). BRAF mutation positively influenced median PFS, both in the entire TKI-treated cohort (median PFS 34.7 months versus 11.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.29; 95% CI 0.09-0.98; p = 0.03) and in the TKI-treated PTC cohort (n = 22) [log-rank p = 0.086; HR 2.95; 95 % CI 0.81-10.70). However, in TKI-treated patients, PDTC histologic subtype was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS identified in the multivariate analysis (HR 2.36; 95% CI 1.01-5.54; p = 0.048).

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects.
(Methods) We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes.
(Results) The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005).

118,"Article: (Background) Limited and conflicting data exist on an association between mammographic density (MD) and re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins during initial BCS is unknown.
(Methods) All women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [≥2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed.
(Results) Of 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p<0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043).

(Design) Pretest, post-test with a control group.
(Setting) Two rural, private care clinics in southeastern Idaho providing immediate care services.
(Participants) Eight medical providers at a clinic where interventions were employed (active intervention group) and seven medical providers in a clinic where no interventions occurred (control group).
(Interventions) Medical providers in the active intervention group had: 1) education from pharmacists concerning the appropriate use of lower-cost alternatives compared with expensive focus medications 2) counter samples and patient sample handouts available to dispense to patients at their own discretion.
(Main outcome measures) The percentage of the total yearly prescriptions for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antihistamines, and acid-relief medications that consisted of focus-COX-2 NSAIDs, nonsedating antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), respectively.
(Results) The prescribing behavior of medical providers in the active intervention and control groups were significantly different at baseline in all three categories of focus medications. This suggested that the results should focus on changes across the two years of the study within the intervention and control groups rather than across the two groups. Medical providers in the intervention group significantly decreased the use of COX-2 NSAID prescriptions relative to total NSAID prescriptions following active intervention (38.9% in year 1 versus 23.7% in year 2, P<0.05). Over the same two time periods, a nonstatistically significant decrease in COX-2 NSAID prescribing was seen at the control site (67.5% versus 62%, P>0.05). Education and counter sampling did not stop medical providers from significantly increasing the total yearly prescriptions for antihistamines and acid-relief medications that consisted of focus-nonsedating antihistamines (86.7% versus 93.1%, P<0.05) and PPIs (68.9% versus 86.2%, P<0.05). Statistically significant increases in the prescribing of focus-nonsedating antihistamines (77.9% versus 98.3%, P<0.05) and PPIs (77.5% versus 91.4%, P<0.05) were also observed in the control group.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether CD patients are capable of developing tolerance to gluten.
(Methods) All 77 adult patients from our hospital known to have biopsy-proven CD for more than 10 years were invited to participate. We investigated symptoms, gluten consumption, antibodies for CD and other autoimmunity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing, bone mineral density, and performed small bowel biopsies. Tolerance was defined as no immunological or histological signs of CD while consuming gluten.
(Results) Sixty-six patients accepted participation, but after review of the diagnostic biopsies 53 were found to have true CD. Twenty-three percent of patients had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted gluten transgression and 62% followed the GFD. Patients on a GFD had significantly more osteoporosis.

This study was done to develop criteria that could successfully predict the outcome of surgery based on preoperative data, including percutaneous liver biopsy, allowing a more selective approach to the care of these babies.
(Methods) The charts and biopsy results of 31 patients who underwent a Kasai procedure for biliary atresia between 1984 and 1994 were reviewed. Values for preoperative albumin, bilirubin, age of patient at Kasai, and lowest postoperative bilirubin were recorded. Surgical success was defined as postoperative bilirubin that returned to normal. A pathologist blinded to the child's eventual outcome graded the pre-Kasai needle liver biopsy results according to duct proliferation, ductal plate lesion, bile in ducts, lobular inflammation, giant cells, syncitial giant cells, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, hepatocyte ballooning, bile in zone 1, 2, and 3, cholangitis, and end-stage cirrhosis. Clinical outcome was then predicted.
(Results) Success after portoenterostomy could not reliably be predicted based on gender, age at Kasai, preoperative bilirubin or albumin levels. Histological criteria, however, predicted outcome in 27 of 31 patients (P<.01). Fifteen of 17 clinical successes were correctly predicted; as were 12 of 14 clinical failures (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 88%). Individually, the presence of syncitial giant cells, lobular inflammation, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, and cholangitis, were each associated with failure of the portoenterostomy (P<.05).

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic parameters.
(Results) A ROC curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for platelet count, which was 205 (× 10(9)/L). Patients with platelet count ≤ 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival than patients with a platelet count>205 (60.7 vs. 31.6 %, P<0.001). The 5-year survival of patients either with platelet count ≤ 205 or>205 were similar (68.6 vs. 58.8 %, P = 0.085) when the nodes were negative. However, the 5-year survival of patients with platelet count ≤ 205 was better than that of patients with a platelet count>205 when the nodes were involved (32.0 vs. 12.7 %, P = 0.004).
